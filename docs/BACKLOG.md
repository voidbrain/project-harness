### F-052

**Evaluation dependencies raise a run when their test content changes**

| Signal | Priority | Status | Effort |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| 🔴 | 🔶 P2 | Open | 🟢 Small |

💻 **→ Human action required: No**<br />Implement T01 (setting, freshness report and rule), then release.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Issue** | A project that pins an evaluation dependency shipping test packs gets no signal when a new pin adds or changes cases: in a derived project, a pin added 28 cases that were never run or indexed. The harness already reports its own newer releases at session start, but not new test content in a project’s evaluation dependencies. |
| **Reproduce** | In a project with an evaluation dependency, pin a release that adds a pack: `check:freshness` and CI stay silent. |
| **Check** | A project declares evaluation dependencies in `.harness.json` (`evaluations`: name and a project-owned pending command that exits 1 and lists cases when any are unrun); `check:freshness` runs each and reports pending cases at session start; BACKLOG-RULES: a pending case keeps an open record naming it until a run covers it, and running real models stays owner-approved; APPLY explains adoption. No evaluation tool is named or imported by the template; a project without the setting is unaffected. Released as a minor version. |

**Feature steps** (remaining estimates; status is not parent acceptance)

| Step | Remaining effort | Status |
|---|---|---|
| F-052-T01 — Declared evaluation dependencies reported by check:freshness, with a backlog rule | 🟢 Small — 1 focused day<br />2026-11-11: Owner decision 2026-11-11: the harness and Gauntlet are reused by future projects, so 'a dependency release that adds test content raises a run' is a generic rule here, with no import of any evaluation tool. Estimate, not a measurement. | Planned |

<details>
<summary>Next action, estimates and evidence</summary>

**Next action / closure evidence:** T01; release as minor. Closes on the release tag after green CI; projects adopt it in their own backlogs.

**Estimates:** Small, about 1 focused day, estimated 2026-11-11.

## Other changes

Published v4.7.0 after PR #99 / CI42887014187 passed169 fixtures/check and independent review fixes. [PR #100](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/pull/100) records closure. F-048 is closed and archived with completed step table and all source limitations; no active feature remains. Release closure is independently owned here, with consumer reconciliation separately owned.

Published [v4.1.0](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/tree/v4.1.0) at `a8a358e` after PR #80 passed owned CI and independent review. F-046 closes on the published tag; project adoption is independently owned.

Published [v4.0.0](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/tree/v4.0.0) at `bdec31f`; release record F-045 archived after green CI and fresh-context review.

Published [v3.4.0](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/tree/v3.4.0), tagged on `main` `a2c90f5` after [#73](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/pull/73) merged on green [CI 42353515325](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/actions/runs/42353515325). F-041–F-043 are closed and archived with their full history in [#74](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/pull/74).

Published [v3.3.0](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/tree/v3.3.0), tagged on `main` `a0ae25e` after [#66](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/pull/66)–[#70](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/pull/70) merged on green CI. F-032–F-037 are closed and archived with their history. The push guard is not installed in this clone and no behaviour-check runner is configured here: both are the owner's choice.

Published [v3.1.1](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/tree/v3.1.1): annotated tag `bea6c60140f9ecf4fb9fa75849da5578fd5667e6` resolves remotely to approved main commit `7a81b930c5cbd689b8db9d4c74f9dd42ec1e7031`. [Publication run 41243779205](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/actions/runs/41243779205) passed every verification/publication step, including all 72 fixtures. B-013/B-014 and F-026–F-030 are verified, closed and archived with their original IDs/dates/history. [#58](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/pull/58) removes the one-time operational workflow and records closure. No release action or human dependency remains.

Full audit F-031 verified and closed 2026-10-31 after [#55](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/pull/55) merged with [CI 41228352936](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/actions/runs/41228352936) green. All eight areas have a dated full report/manifest; both confirmed defects are fixed with failing-before/passing-after regressions. Those records were release-pending at that review; the verified v3.1.1 publication above now closes them. Historical audit prose remains unchanged.

Published [v2.2.2](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/tree/v2.2.2) at verified commit `0764a36`. [Publication run 41221315726](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/actions/runs/41221315726) passed every verify/publish step and all 56 fixtures. B-011, B-012 and F-021–F-025 are closed and archived with their complete history. [PR #51](https://github.com/voidbrain/project-harness/pull/51) removes the one-time publication workflow. No publication blocker remains for v2.2.2. The newer cumulative release was subsequently published through the one-time workflow above. No new permission request or consumer dependency is implied.

Follow [Backlog rules](BACKLOG-RULES.md) for updating records, reconciling PR/CI evidence, stale-state review, closure/archiving, human dependencies and table validation. Preserve stable IDs and existing user edits.

Each item shows its ID and title, a signal table (priority, status, remaining effort), Human action required (🧑 Yes / 💻 No), and Issue / Reproduce / Check. Expand the closed details for next actions, estimate rationale, PR history, dates and verification. Effort: 🟢 Small ≤1 day · 🟡 Medium 2–3 days · 🔴 Large ≥4 days. Status and verification evidence describe progress; effort is an estimate of work still required. A `---` line ends every item.
